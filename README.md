# Non-Conventional AMD GPU Characterization Tool and Methodology

Set of benchmarks ana analysis tools to characterize the response of AMD GPU architecture to different workloads whily using non-conventional (extreme undervoltage) DVFS settings


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites (for CentOS 7.0)


* Python 3.8
* Anaconda/Miniconda enviroment
* ROCm 3.0
* ROCblas
* MIopen-hip
* MIopen-gemm


### Installing

* Create conda enviroment for analysis tool

```
conda env create -f environment/environment.yml
```
* ROCm 3.0
```
sudo yum install rocm-dkms rock-dkms
sudo yum install rocblas
sudo yum install miopen-hip
sudo yum install miopengemm
```

## Running the tests

Use the exploreBenchmark Python script to run a Benchmark on different GPU DVFS configurations

### General example for running benchmark
```
python exploreBenchmark.py -b <location of executable file> -e -c -v -t 10 -lc 7 --step 25 --reset --config <configuration file>
```

### Example for running SFU benchmark
```
python exploreBenchmark.py -b Benchmarks/Core/ALU/SFU/Float/sp/eventPerformance_SFU_Float_sp -e -c -v -t 10 -lc 7 --step 25 --reset --config configExploreFiles/11.txt
```

## Runing analysis tool
```
python analysisBenchmark.py -p <location of results files> -c <config file>
```
